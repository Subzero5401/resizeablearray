# resizeablearray
I wanted to understand and develop my own resizeable array . 
This program i learned alot about dynamically allocating memory. The use of pointer. I think i was a fun and interesting experiment . 
This is only good for integer type . My next move for this project is to learn and create a template class so anyone can use different types.
